This is an entry for the style of session files used by gdm/kdm/lightdm for
the CDE desktop.

https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest

It is the opposite style to contrib/desktop2dt that takes desktop files and
converts them for use with dtlogin.

Language selection is the job of the login manager (xdm, dtlogin, kdm,
etc).
