### 2.5.0 (stable) 7/23/2022

This release is the first to use autotools for building.  The Imake
build system is gone.  No doubt there is more improvement that can be
done here (support cross compiling, make uninstall, etc), but
everything is functional.

General highlights of this release:

- as usual, MANY bug fixes, code improvements and the usual assortment
  of coverity issues.

- completion of autotools conversion from Imake

- update ksh93 from the ksh93 maintainer Martijn Dekker

- A rework of the documentation system, fixing many issues

- dtbuilder fixes

- PAM and utempter support on Linux and FreeBSD.  This makes it
  possible to remove SUID root perms on dtsession and dtterm.

- several issues in dtbuilder addressed

- tiling and scaling of backgrounds are supported on systems with the
  Xrender development package involved.

- Fullscreen apps are better supported with proper support for some
  _NET_WM properties.

- many improvments to bring a lot of the code up to more modern
  standards

To build CDE without the documentation system (help, dtinfo books) you
can pass --disable-docs to the configure command.

By default, only the English language is built.  The other 4 languages
can be built as long as the same requirements as previous CDE releases
are met.  For example to build the spanish language, use
--enable-spanish.  Unlike previous versions of CDE, you are no longer
forced to build all supported languages.

Run configure with --help to see what options are available.

See the following git shortlog for more information on specific
changes for this release (nearly 800 commits).

My thanks to the people below who contributed to this release!

### 2.4.0 (stable) 6/3/2021

This release adds support (and converts) to UTF-8 encoding for all
message catalogs.  The help and dtinfo stuff (being based on docbook
2) is still using ISO8859-* encodings.

This will also be the last release to use imake/Imakefiles for
building.  Once released, the autotools-conversion branch will be
merged into master shortly thereafter, and future releases will use
autotools.

The main highlights of this release:

- Conversion of message catalogs to UTF-8

- The ksh93 code used to build dtksh has been updated to something
  from this century (hash: 66e1d446), and a lot of work has gone into
  making it work with CDE's dtksh

- Many build related warnings and bugs have been addressed as usual.

- Linux (and some BSD's) support PAM and utempter allowing the removal
  of the SUID root bit for dtsession and dtterm

- Preliminary risc-v support

- Preliminary support for the musl C library

- many fixes related to old K&R code, new compiler versions and
  other related fixes

Here is the git "short" log:

      Prepare for 2.3.2 release: HISTORY and version number change


#######################################################################
### 2.3.1 (stable) 11/15/2019

This stable release comes from the 2.3.0a development release, and
adds a few more minor fixes and cleanups.

The main highlights of this release:

- All languages are built by default on Linux again.

- Hundreds (perhaps thousands) of compiler warnings fixed.  Far too
  many remain.

- Hundreds of Coverity fixes.

- Removal of large chunks of code, docs and the like pertaining to
  unsupported systems and plain old ancient cruft that serves no
  useful purpose anymore.

- All non-ansi C functions (K&R style) have finally been ansi'fied.

- All C/C++ 'register' declarations have finally been removed.

- Integration of Antonis Tsolomitis' desktop_approots contribution.

  This adds default actions for a variety of common file types.
  Support is provided via a new dtopen script that is used to launch an
  appropriate viewer for an appropriate file type.

  The types supported are: images (jpg, png, etc), videos (mpg, avi,
  mp4, etc), PDF files, and Postscript files.

  Additionally, icons and actions for various common utilties are also
  provided, like one for VLC.

  The various "view" helpers currently installed are:

  dtopen_vimage - view an image file.  Defaults to xv, display, and
  gimp, in that order.  Override with the environment variable
  DTOPEN_VIMAGE.

  dtopen_vpdf - view a PDF file.  Defaults to okular, xpdf.  Override
  with the environment variable DTOPEN_VPDF.

  dtopen_vps - view a postscript file.  Defaults to mgv, gv.  Override
  with the environment variable DTOPEN_VPS.

  dtopen_vvideo - view a video file.  Defaults to vlc, ffplay.
  Override with the environment variable DTOPEN_VVIDEO.

  When a request is made to view one of these file types, the list of
  possible viewers will be tried, in order, until one is found.  If
  none are found, an error message will be displayed.

  Add environment variable overrides to your ~/.dtprofile file if you
  don't like the default(s).  ex:

  export DTOPEN_VVIDEO="mpv"

- sgml is gone.  We always use CDE's nsgmls program now.  In time,
  this too will be removed and the system's nsgmls installation will
  be used and required as an external dependency.

- The included tcl interpreter is gone, we always use the system TCL
  interpreter now (8.5+).

- A potential exploit in dtprintinfo was also addressed.  This
  affected Solaris CDE, but ours still had "issues" with amazingly
  stupid code. It is no longer installed SUID root.

- aarch64 support.

- scroll wheel support for dtterm and dtfile is working now.

### 2.3.0 (stable) 07/06/2018

This is a very long overdue stable release.  It incorporates all of
the fixes in the 2.2.4a development release plus:

- tooltalk/ttsession:

  - on newer Linux/TIRPC systems, make sure listen() is called on a
    server socket.  This fixes an infinite loop problem seen with with
    newer glibc and TIRPC implementations (SUSE Tumbleweed, ArchLinux)

  - default to localhost when hostname IP resolution fails (all
    platforms).  There is no longer any need to add your unresolvable
    hostname to the localhosts line in your /etc/hosts file.

- improved build support on Solaris/OpenIndiana systems (gcc and SunStudio).

- BSD improvments:
  - no need to create X11/Motif symlinks prior to compiling CDE.
  - Fix native clang builds
  - Fix some GCC builds

- remove ancient XmeXpm* defines

Here is the git shortlog since the 2.2.4a development release:

Jon Trulson (14):
      libDtTerm: Fix for a coredump seen on OpenBSD
      dtinfo/freebsd: fix a (int)NULL cast in DtSR_SearchEngine.C
      FreeBSD 11: Don't use imported x11/motif, use installed versions for build
      building_release_archive: omit '-src' in archive filename
      OpenBSD 6+: use installed X11 and Motif
      XPM: Replace calls to XmeXpm*() with regular Xpm*()
      FreeBSD 11: Fix clang (v6) builds
      FreeBSD: turn off some warnings
      CDE-ICONS: create compatibility symlinks as relative rather than absolute
      OpenBSD: tone down compiler warnings a bit
      libtt: if local hostname lookup fails, default to localhost
      linux/site.def: use an if !defined() gaurd for DtLocalesToBuild
      slib/mp_rpc_server: TIRPC: force a listen() call on the server socket

  ## 2.2.4a (development) 06/08/2018

  This is a long overdue development release.

  This release corrects several known issues with newer BSD based
  operating systems, enables TIRPC by default for all Linux systems, and
  corrects several hundred bugs and warnings (compiler and coverity).

  Using TIRPC on Linux means that you should no longer need to configure
  rpcbind to run in insecure (-i) mode.

  For Linux, only the C/en_US locales are built by default now.  The
  available extra locales are:

  fr_FR.ISO8859-1, de_DE.ISO8859-1, es_ES.ISO8859-1, and it_IT.ISO8859-1

  To build for these locales, you must ensure the locale support is
  present on your OS (see the wiki), and then you can:

  A) Edit config/cf/site.def and add the desired locales to
     DtLocalesToBuild in the LinuxArchitecture section, or

  B) call make World with the following option:

     make World IMAKE_DEFINES='-DDtLocalesToBuild="fr_FR.ISO8859-1"'

     to build the French Locale, for example.

  For the BSD's, All of the current ones (OpenBSD 6.x and FreeBSD 11.x)
  should compile now.  Since we no longer use XPrint, the BSD's
  should not need to compile their own modified Motif libraries any
  more.  Just install a Motif development package, and go.

  Here is the git shortlog:

### 2.2.2 (stable) 07/27/2014

A lot of fixes and improvements in this release.  CDE can be built on
more modern Linuxes and BSDs.  An initial stab at illimios support is
also present.

Here is the shortlog:

Eugene Doudine (7):
      Fixes the bug #17 dtsession can't validate passwords longer than 8 characters when the session is locked
      Fixed bug #27 dtfile space handling bug
      Fixed bug #32 dtfile table formatting bug with non-latin filenames
      Fixes the off-by-one bug in RegisterInGrid(), which caused dtfile's desktop icons on the right edge of the screen (if desktop width is not a multiple of icon with) to be registered on the next workspace or (in the case of the last workspace) beyond the desktop_grid array (possibly causing segfaults).
      Fixes several issues with grid registration of the dtwm panel on dtfile startup and on workspace addition:
      Fixes a small bug in grid registration: when an object is placed over another object (can be done manually) and then removed from there, the registration of the covered object is removed as well (that is it's cell is considered empty).
      Fixes the bug, which caused dtterm to show stripes of wrong color between text lines when using fontsets that include fonts of slightly different heights.

  ## 2.2.0d (development, beta) 05/30/2013

  - We are being bold this time, and promoting CDE to Beta.

  - More work on dtinfo.  It now mostly compiles but is not quite ready
    for prime time.  It is not built be default.

  - dtksh now builds on linux systems.

  - We do not build Motif man pages anymore.

  - X11 screensaver extension support now works in dtsession on Linux.

  - Some screen locking issues on the BSD's have been fixed.

  - /usr/sbin/sendmail is now the default mailer on OpenBSD

  - Basic support for Xinerama has been added to dtlogin and dtsession
    using a new DtXinerama library.

  - Resolve many more more compiler warnings


  ## 2.2.0c (development, alpha3) 10/4/2012

  - Many 64b issues have been fixed, related to XtVaGetValues(), missing
    prototypes, erroneous assumptions regarding the size of ints and
    pointers, etc.  Many still lurk in the shadows.

  - help files should build now on 64b systems with compiler
    optimization enabled.

  - FreeBSD is pretty much fully functional now.  OpenBSD and NetBSD are
    close behind.

  - FreeBSD uses a authorized FreeBSD Foundation specific logo on
    dtlogin.

  - a few hundred more compiler warnings fixed :)

  - more missing prototypes added to XmPrivate.h


  ## 2.2.0b (development, alpha2) 9/6/2012

  - This release incoporates approximately 200 patches from various
    people around the planet.

  - initial BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD) support.

  - wider support for various Linux distributions - Redhat, Arch,
    Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu.  See a full list of currently operational
    platforms and their statuses at:

    https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/SupportedPlatforms/

  - many fixes to better support 64b systems.  There is still much work
    needed in this regard.

  - most modules are operational.  dtinfo is not operational on any
    platform yet.  dtksh is not yet operational on linux systems.

  - several thousand compiler warnings have been addressed.
    Unfortunately, there are still several thousand more waiting :(
    Some of this code is *old*.


  ## 2.2.0a (development, alpha1) 8/6/2012

  - This is the initial release of CDE form The Open Group based on
    2.1.30.

    Minimal changes to get it compiling on some common linux distros,
    primarily 32bit.
