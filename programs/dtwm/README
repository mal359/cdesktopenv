Conditional Compilation 
-----------------------

The following is a listing of the conditional compilation switches that
are "not obvious." Excluded are hardware or OS identifiers (e.g. __ultrix),
header file include flags, and macros (e.g. ABS).

    DEBUG
	Turns on code that prints out error messages (specifically
	protocol errors).

    DEBUGGER
	Turns on code to help debugging Help-on-item.

    DEBUG_ICON_BOX
	Turns on code that alters iconbox spacing to help debug iconbox.
	(?)

    DEBUG_RESOURCE_DATABASE
	Turns on code that dumps out dtwm's local resource database 
	to aid in debugging resource problems.

    DEBUG_SESSION_HINTS
	If defined, the session hints property is left on the root
	window after being read. Normally, it is deleted.

    ICCC_COMPLIANT
        This enables stricter ICCCM compliance. Specifically, some
	clients didn't get WM_PROTOCOLS quite right.

    INTEGRATION_TESTING_
	Swaps assignment of black and white on wait state cursor as
	a quick indicator of which client is showing the wait state.

    LARGECURSORS
	Allows cursors larger than 16x16.

    MESSAGE_CAT
	Enables message catalog code for local language support.

    MOTIF_DEFAULT_ICON
	Enables the default window icon with four buttons.

    OLD_CODE
	Vestigal code.

    R2_COMPAT
	Enables support for old clients that still pass window geometry
	hint information in WM_NORMAL_HINTS.

    UNMAP_ON_RESTART
	All windows are unmapped on restart.
